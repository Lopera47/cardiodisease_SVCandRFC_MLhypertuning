Research question:
1. Is possible to figure out if a patient could have a cardiac disease using a machine learning classification model?
2. Which would be the best model to classify the possibility of cardiac disease based on a cardio-exam dataset?

General information:
1 This is a personal project done by Luis Lopera 
2 The main aim is to improve my machine learnig skills aplying a SVC and RFC models
3 In this project I used a dataset from kaggle based on a cardio disease exams
4 The requierements are on requierement.txt
